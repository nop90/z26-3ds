/*
 Hardware I/O address bits

 Dan Boris' 2600 schematics show the TIA and RIOT chips hooked up to the
 CPU with the following address lines hooked up.

   12 | 11  10  09  08 | 07  06  05  04 | 03	02  01	00 
 
    X                     X                                  TIA
    X            X        X                                  RIOT

 If the 1000h bit (bit 12) is set, it's a ROM access.  This is handled
 in banks.c and we'll never come here.

 Otherwise it's a hardware access.

 If the 200h bit is	set and the 80h bit is set then it's a RIOT access.
 If the 200h bit is not set and the 80h bit is set then it's a RAM access.
 If the 200h bit is not set and the 80h bit is not set then it's a TIA access.
